# Temperature_converter
Build simple temperature converter using javafx.

This application uses two text fields to allow the user to enter a temperature in either Celsius or Fahrenheit. 
It also provides two buttons to convert the temperature between the two units. 
The conversion is performed using simple arithmetic calculations. 
If the user enters an invalid input (such as a non-numeric value), the application displays an error message in the corresponding text field.
